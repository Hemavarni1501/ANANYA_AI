Product Requirements Document

Project Name: ANANYA-AI
Full Name: Bias-Aware Academic Support System for Inclusive Smart Campuses
Product Type: Ethical AI-powered academic support platform
Target Users: Students, Faculty, Academic Administrators
Deployment Context: Smart Campuses (Universities / Colleges)

1. Problem Statement
Existing AI-based academic tools primarily optimize for performance metrics (scores, speed, completion) and implicitly assume:

Uniform learning ability

Equal prior academic exposure

Single dominant language proficiency

This leads to hidden academic bias, particularly affecting:

Students from diverse linguistic backgrounds

First-generation learners

Students with slower learning pace or alternative comprehension styles

These biases are systemic, unintentional, and invisible, yet they result in unequal academic outcomes.

2. Product Vision
ANANYA-AI aims to detect, reduce, and mitigate academic bias through:

Bias-aware learning analytics

Adaptive content delivery

Ethical, privacy-preserving AI

Inclusive UI/UX design

The system supports students without labelling or profiling, while providing only anonymized, aggregate insights to faculty.

3. Core Objectives (P0)
Identify learning barriers without demographic profiling

Adapt academic content dynamically to individual learning needs

Detect bias in content complexity, pacing, and representation

Preserve student privacy through anonymization and aggregation

Promote equitable learning outcomes in smart campuses

4. User Roles
4.1 Student
Receives adaptive academic support

Views personal progress (non-comparative)

Interacts with AI assistant (ANANYA)

Uses accessibility and language tools

4.2 Faculty
Views anonymized learning patterns

Receives bias alerts and inclusivity recommendations

Creates and uploads academic content

Uses bias-checking tools for teaching material

4.3 Admin
Monitors ethical AI compliance

Oversees privacy and system health

Reviews bias detection performance

Configures system-level policies

5. P0 Features (Must-Have)
5.1 Bias-Aware Student Learning Interface
Adaptive explanation depth

Language simplification

Representation variation (examples, formats)

Accessibility tools (font, contrast, pace)

5.2 Bias Detection Engine
Detects:

Language complexity bias

Pace mismatch

Prior exposure gaps

Operates on interaction patterns only

No demographic or identity inference

5.3 Adaptive Content Generation
Multiple difficulty variants per concept

Real-time adjustment based on comprehension signals

NLP-based explanation rewriting

5.4 Privacy-First Analytics
No individual student identification

Aggregated insights only

Differential privacy applied to analytics

5.5 Faculty Analytics Dashboard
Learning pattern trends

Bias detection alerts

Content effectiveness metrics

Inclusive teaching recommendations

6. P1 Features (Post-MVP)
Cultural sensitivity engine

Knowledge graph-based learning paths

Federated learning across campuses

LMS integrations (Moodle, Canvas)

7. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)
Student ranking or peer comparison

Predicting intelligence or ability

Demographic-based personalization

Surveillance or proctoring features

8. Success Metrics
Educational Impact
Reduction in repeated misunderstanding patterns

Improved comprehension time consistency

Reduced dropout or disengagement signals

Ethical & Technical
Zero exposure of identifiable student data

Bias detection precision validated through testing

WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

9. Constraints & Assumptions
AI explanations must remain academically accurate

Bias mitigation must not dilute academic rigor

System must function across multilingual environments

Internet connectivity may be intermittent (campus networks)

10. MVP Definition
The MVP is successful when:

Students receive adaptive, bias-aware explanations

Faculty receive anonymized bias insights

No personal student data is exposed

System demonstrates measurable bias mitigation
